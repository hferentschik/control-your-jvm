# Control your JVM

*09/09/2014*

This respository contains all the information around a presentation of mine showcasing the
various JVM provided command line tools. The focus of the presentation are on
[jps](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jps.html),
[jstat(d)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jstat.html),
[jinfo](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jinfo.html),
[jsadebugd](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jsadebugd.html),
[jhat](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jhat.html),
[jmap](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jmap.html),
[jcmd](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jcmd.html),
[jstack](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jstack.html) and
[jmc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jmc.html).

You can find the slides of the presentation in pdf format [here](control-your-jvm.pdf).

For demo purposes I use a small [demo program](resources/docker/demo-programs/src/Demo.java)
as well as different versions of [Wildfly](http://wildfly.org/). All examples are using
[Docker](http://docker.io) and can easily be run following the commands listed in the
[manuscript](manus.md).

There is also a [list](links.md) of various links which I found helpful while working on
the presentation.
